     	<h3>What is Relive Primitive?</h3>
        <p class="lead">
        	Relive Primitive is a Christ-centered wilderness survival school offering you the finest hands-on education using only primitive skills. You will learn how to live off the land with just the shirt on your back.

        <h4>How are we different?</h4>
        <p>
        	Unlike many schools, we are neither a military-style bootcamp nor a kooky new-age cult. You will never be asked to partake in some faux native ritual or shamanistic (demonic) activity. We don't refer to nature as "Mother Earth". Instead, we focus on a quality Christian outdoor education. Our foundation is the inspired word of God.

        <h4>Where have we been?</h4>
        <p>
        	Relive Primitive was formerly known as 'Voice of the Wilderness' and was founded in 2002. Our primary focus has always been on Homeschool Groups as well as offering extra-curricular activites for private schools. Based in Northern Indiana, we held dozens of classes over a 100 mile radius. Hundreds of homeschoolers have taken these life changing courses. 
        </p>
        <p>
        	In 2008, the founder Matthew Smithers, returned to college and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Web Design &amp; Interactive Media. This is in addition to previous educational pursuits of Anthropology as well as time in Bible College. 
        </p>
        <p>
        	As a result of this hiatus, Matthew is now a master of both modern and ancient technologies. Relive Primitive is a relaunch of the older program but with a focus on sharing ancient skills through hands-on courses and modern technology .

        <h4>Where are we going?</h4>
        <p>
        	Homeschooling education will remain our primary focus. In addition, we are developing courses for adults and the general public. We are also designing amazing web and interactive experiences to engage the modern world. 
        </p>
        <p>
        	Very soon, students will have access to exclusive online videos, ebooks, podcasts, and more through course enrollement and membership. There are plans for an online forum, as well for an ecommerce store offering the best survival gear. Several web applications are in the works that will make the outdoor life even more awesome! Trapperly is a trapline management tool and is scheduled to be released this year. There are many irons in the fire, so <a href="#">subscribe</a> to our email newsletter if you want to keep up.
